Microstrip Patch Antenna Design Repository

This repository contains a collection of folders detailing the design and application of microstrip patch antennas, compiled during my internship where I used CST Studio Suite software. In my learning, I have tried to incorporate a novel metasurface structure in the antenna design to further enhance its gain and bandwidth.
